As a data scientist I tend to write simple code, using only the minimal amount of external
packages required to complete the task. Most of my software is used internally in the labs I work for
and is tailored for specific uses or data-sets, however I am a strong advocate for open source development.

My software is primarily written in R or Python, though occasional bash scripts and GNU Octave
code are utilized for specific tasks. All of my documents are typeset with <span class="latex">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</span> or R Markdown.

### Freelance / Collaboration

I enjoy solving puzzles and I find coding/data science challenges to be exciting. If you are interested in collaboration or hiring me for a freelance project <a href = "mailto: jdforsy@g.clemson.edu">please feel free to contact me</a>.

Previous projects include teaching R & RMarkdown, analyzing an upstart brewery's brand
ambassador program performance, web scraping for sports statistics, and
using machine learning to predict future housing market changes.
