Tower, this is ghost rider requesting a flyby... Check out this shot captured by our phenocam at our US-HB1 tidal salt marsh site. We use these cameras to track plant phenology by taking a series of photographs through time, but caught a (grumpy?) bird mid-flight at this instance.

### More about Phenocams...

Our lab uses a "phenocam" (digital camera set up at a fixed location to capture time-lapse images) to measure the phenology of plants. By taking a snapshot every 30 minutes we can track everything from tidal levels to canopy photosynthesis to leaf color/senescence in the fall. 

You can keep on eye on our phenocams by [clicking here]({{< ref "/livepheno" >}}).
