Check out this amazing shot captured by our phenocam at our US-HB1 tidal salt marsh site! We use these cameras to track plant phenology by taking a photo every 30 minutes. Perfect Timing!

### Do Plants Breathe?

Our lab uses a "phenocam" (digital camera set up at a fixed location to capture time-lapse images) to measure the phenology of plants. By taking a snapshot every 30 minutes we can track everything from tidal levels to canopy photosynthesis to leaf color/senescence in the fall. 

This time we captured even more than we bargained for when this snap from our US-HB1 salt marsh site at North Inlet Crab Haul Creek in South Carolina. 

Keep on eye on our phenocams (updated every 30 minutes) by [clicking here <i class='fas fa-camera'></i>]({{< ref "/livepheno" >}}) and let me know if you see anything great!
