We have recently released 3 years of data from our site <a href="https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-HB1" target="_blank"> US-HB1</a> to the Ameriflux network. US-HB1 (North Inlet Crab Haul Creek) is in a tidally-influenced <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> salt marsh. For more information, please see visit our Ameriflux page or the reference below. 

Also, feel free to [contact us directly](mailto:tohallo@clemson.edu) if your research is in the areas of water or carbon cycling in coastal wetlands or pine forests and you are interested in discussing your work or potential for collaboration.

### Reference
