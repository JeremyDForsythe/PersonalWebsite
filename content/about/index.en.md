My name is Jeremy Forsythe and I am a Clemson University PhD student interested in
using computer programming and quantitative data analyses to study plant ecology
and climate science. In my spare time I enjoy alternative music, vegan cooking,
running, and learning new programming skills.

* <span style="text-decoration:underline"> Ameriflux Data Pipeline:</span>

  * Our lab is installing and activating a new network of environmental sensor towers
  (Eddy Covariance Flux) that will measure the greenhouse gases, water, and heat exchanged between
  the ecosystems of coastal South Carolina and the atmosphere above.
  * One of my jobs is to develop a workflow to take our high frequency (up to 10x per second)
  data from the sensors through quality checking and processing to create a cleaned dataset
  accessible and usable by anyone interested.
  * We have 4 towers currently built, operating, and registered with the Ameriflux network.

* <span style="text-decoration:underline"> Environmental Drivers of Carbon Capture By Plants:</span>
  * Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are growing at unprecedented rates with
  only two known possible sinks that work fast enough to help offset the sudden rise
  to over 410 ppm (parts per million).
  * When the Oceans, one of these carbon sinks,
  absorb CO2 there are strong negative impacts to the sea's chemistry and life.
  However, terrestrial plants can capture CO2 while providing economic, ecological,
  and cultural benefits to society.
  * My research uses modern Eddy Covariance Flux technology to
  quantify how terrestrial ecosystem productivity (carbon sequestration) is affected by environmental change.

* <span style="text-decoration:underline"> Ecological Forecasting:</span>
  * Ecology as a science has primarily been focused on describing events that have already past.
  We are realizing more and more that ecosystems do not always respond to environmental change
  as they have previously, especially under a changing climate.
  * In my research I am developing models that combine statistics, data science, and ecological principles to make predictions about how ecosystem services to society may change in the future.
